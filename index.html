  <div class="instructions">
    <strong>How to Use This Tree:</strong><br>
    This interactive tool guides agents through escalated borrower conversations. Begin with the Full Past Due offer and follow the nested branches that reflect borrower responses.
  </div>

  <details>
    <summary>üöÄ Offer: Full Past Due Payment</summary>
    <span class="label">Agent Response:</span>
    <div class="response">"At this point, your loan is more than 90 days past due and has been assigned for repossession. However, because the vehicle hasn‚Äôt been secured yet, you still have time to resolve the delinquency. The full past due amount to bring the loan current is $[amount]. Are you able to make that payment today?"</div>
    <span class="label">Agent Action:</span>
    <div class="action">If borrower agrees, proceed to schedule payment. If not, proceed to rebuttals.</div>

    <details>
      <summary>üí¨ Borrower: "That‚Äôs too much. I can‚Äôt do all of that today."</summary>
      <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 1:</span>
      <div class="option">"I understand that‚Äôs a large amount. If the full cure isn‚Äôt feasible, we can discuss alternative payments that may delay or stop repossession. Please be aware that your vehicle is currently out for repossession and it may be picked up at any point."</div>
      <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 2:</span>
      <div class="option">"Paying the full past due balance immediately is the most secure way to cancel the repossession order. But let‚Äôs explore if there are other meaningful payment options still available."</div>
      <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 3:</span>
      <div class="option">"Unfortunately, time is critical here. Once the vehicle is secured, payment options become more limited. Acting now gives you the best chance to retain your vehicle."</div>

      <details>
        <summary>üîÅ Borrower Declines ‚Üí Payment to Reduce Delinquency Under 60 Days</summary>
        <span class="label">Agent Response:</span>
        <div class="response">"Your loan is over 90 days past due, and your vehicle has been assigned for repossession. However, it has not yet been secured. You still have a chance to stop the repossession by making a payment that reduces your delinquency to under 60 days past due. That amount today is $[amount]. If you make that payment now, you will also avoid the $450 repossession fee."</div>
        <span class="label">Agent Action:</span>
        <div class="action">If borrower agrees, schedule payment. If not, continue to rebuttals.</div>

        <details>
          <summary>üí¨ Borrower: "I can only do part of the minimum."</summary>
          <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 1:</span>
          <div class="option">"I understand. The sooner you‚Äôre able to reach that threshold, the better. Once the vehicle is secured, the fee is unavoidable. Can we explore what you can afford today and build from there?"</div>
          <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 2:</span>
          <div class="option">"Unfortunately, partial payments that don‚Äôt reduce your delinquency below 60 days won‚Äôt stop the repossession. This policy is in place to protect both you and your vehicle."</div>
          <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 3:</span>
          <div class="option">"At this stage, we can only cancel a repossession order if the delinquency is reduced to under 60 days. From there, we will need to develop a plan to reduce the remaining past due balance to avoid future repossession eligibility."</div>

          <details>
            <summary>üîÅ Borrower Declines ‚Üí Stabilization Payment</summary>
            <span class="label">Agent Response:</span>
            <div class="response">"While a smaller payment today won‚Äôt cancel the repossession, it can still demonstrate effort and reduce the total balance. Can I ask what amount you‚Äôd be able to pay today toward the past due?"</div>
            <span class="label">Agent Action:</span>
            <div class="action">If borrower agrees, schedule payment. If not, continue to rebuttals.</div>

            <details>
              <summary>üí¨ Borrower: "I can do something small, but it won‚Äôt make a dent."</summary>
              <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 1:</span>
              <div class="option">"Making a partial payment now lowers your total balance and could help you reinstate the loan more easily if the vehicle is repossessed."</div>
              <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 2:</span>
              <div class="option">"If the vehicle hasn‚Äôt been secured by then, you may still avoid the $450 fee‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a risk. Setting up a payment now helps lock in that benefit."</div>
              <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 3:</span>
              <div class="option">"Unfortunately, only a payment that brings you under 60 days past due can stop the repossession. But any payment helps reduce the impact."</div>

              <details>
                <summary>üîÅ Borrower Declines ‚Üí Hardship/Settlement</summary>
                <span class="label">Agent Response:</span>
                <div class="response">"We do have hardship relief programs. Would you like to hear about these options?"</div>
                <span class="label">Agent Action:</span>
                <div class="action">Ask probing questions: ‚ÄúHow are you handling your other bills?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat has changed since your last payment?‚Äù Assist borrower or transfer to hardship/settlement support.</div>

                <details>
                  <summary>üí¨ Borrower: "I can‚Äôt pay anything right now."</summary>
                  <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 1:</span>
                  <div class="option">"I hear you. If no payment is received, your account may enter repo assignment shortly after day 72. We still have time to flag your account for hardship review if we act today."</div>
                  <span class="label">Rebuttal Option 2:</span>
                  <div class="option">"At this point, the only way to keep your vehicle from being assigned for recovery is either payment or hardship. We're in the critical window before vendor assignment. By starting hardship today, we‚Äôre at least showing Upstart that action is in progress."</div>
